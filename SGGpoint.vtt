Hello everyone. Thanks for watching this video.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Today we present our work,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Exploiting Edge-Oriented Reasoning for 3D Point-based Scene Graph Analysis.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Scene understanding is a critical problem in computer vision.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In this paper, we propose a 3D point-based scene graph generation framework

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to effectively bridge perception and reasoning to achieve scene understanding.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It contains three sequential stages,

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
scene graph construction,

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
scene graph reasoning,

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and scene graph inference.

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In scene graph construction, for each 3D real-world scan or synthetic scene,

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we firstly sample its point-based representation

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and pass these points into a point cloud processing backbone network,

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
such as PointNet or DGCNN,

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to derive their point-wise features.

16
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Then a symmetric pooling function is performed

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
along the class-agnostic point-to-instance indicator

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to generate the instance-wise node features,

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
followed by the initialisation of our multi-dimensional edge features between the objects.

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
These captured node and edge features will be adopted for constructing the initial

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
scene graph representation for further reasoning operations.

22
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The popular GCN and its variants focus more on node recognition tasks over the edge ones,

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
while underestimating the discriminative potentials of the multi-dimensional edge features.

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Hence, we built our Vanilla EdgeGCN, which simply contains two independent evolution streams

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
for each graph representation.

26
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Encouraged by the recent advances in graph reasoning,

27
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
we further investigated two twinning attentions between nodes and edges representations.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Specifically, we are particularly interested in how the node evolution could benefit from

29
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the visual cues lurking inside the multi-dimensional edge features, and,

30
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
whether the evolved node features could further payback to augment the edge evolution.

31
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
These two assumptions bring us EdgeGCN.

32
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
With EdgeGCN, we could now exploit multi-dimensional edge features to conduct

33
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
more comprehensive reasoning on graph representation learning.

34
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In last stage, two Multilayer Perceptron based inference streams are established

35
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
as Node MLP and Edge MLP with residual connections.

36
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Our ultimate goal is to create a scene graph, whose nodes and edges depict the

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
instance objects and their inner structural relationships, respectively.

38
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
For our real-world scene graph studies, we manually checked and carefully revised

39
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the raw 3DSSG datasets to a cleaned version, with mappings to

40
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
more popular and meaningful sets of instance semantics and structural relationships.

41
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
This cleaned version contains 27 Object classes and 16 types of structural Relationships.

42
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Below are the changes from the raw one:

43
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We outperform other graph reasoning approaches on three related scene graph generation tasks.

44
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
In our ablation studies, we demonstrate the contribution of each module design.

45
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And here is our quantitative comparison with previous work.

46
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Here are more qualitative results.

47
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We also verified EdgeGCN on conventional graph representation learning tasks,

48
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
including 3 node-wise classifications on citation datasets,

49
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
which are Cora, CiteSeer, and Pubmed,

50
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and 2 whole-graph recognitions for molecular analysis on Tox21 and BBBP.

51
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
All models are repeatedly trained and evaluated for 50 runs.

52
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Thanks for watching.
